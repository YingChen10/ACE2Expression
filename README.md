# ACE2Expression
 Comparison of the 2019-nCoV cell-entry receptor (ACE2) expression among individuals
In this study, we investigate the demographic determinants of ACE2 expression from the cancer-related transcriptome data. We show that ACE2 expression is not affected during tumorigenesis and that Asians do not have higher ACE2 expression than other races.
